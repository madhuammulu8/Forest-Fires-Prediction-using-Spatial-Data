#Abstract
Our project comprises gathering and processing historical records of fire incidents in order to study the fire events and discover the patterns and links with multiple characteristics, including wind speed, air temperature, humidity, precipitation, Rain, etc. The two major objectives of the study will be to predict the predicted fire perimeter and to pinpoint in the map. With the use of this information, we can locate any potential risk areas and, if required, evacuate. In addition, the project will construct and project forest fire hotspots onto a geographical map

We have used the Spatial dataset which is publicly available for research from the UC Irvine data repository
Given the data we predict the forest fire area and we use different machine learning models to predict the area burnt and we also project our burnt land area in Maps using Folium
